    <title>Testing</title>
    <para>One of the biggest benefits of CQRS, and especially that of event sourcing is that it is
        possible to express tests purely in terms of Events and Commands. Both being functional
        components, Events and Commands have clear meaning the the domain expert of business owner.
        This means that tests expressed in terms of Events and Commands don't only have a functional
        meaning, it also means that they hardly depend on any implementation choices.</para>
    <sect1>
        <title>Behavior Driven Testing</title>
        <para>The command handling component is typically the component in any CQRS based
            architecture that contains the most complexity. Being more complex than the others, this
            also means that there are extra test related requirements for this component. Simply
            put: the more complex a component, the better it must be tested.</para>
        <para>Although being more complex, the API of a command handling component is fairly easy.
            It has command coming in, and events coming out. In some cases, there might be a query
            as part of command execution. Other than that, commands and events are the only part of
            the API. This means that it is possible to completely define a test scenario in terms of
            events and commands. Typically, in the shape of:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>given certain events in the past,</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>when executing this command,</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>expect these events to be published and/or stored.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Axon Framework provides a test fixture that allows you to do exactly that. This
            GivenWhenThenTestFixture allows you to configure a certain infrastructure, composed of
            the necessary command handler and repository, and express you scenario in terms of
            given-when-then events and commands.</para>
        <para>The following example shows the usage of the given-when-then test fixture with JUnit
            4:</para>

                            given-when-then style tests. It is created in configuration stage, which
                            allows us to configure the components that we need to process the
                            command, such as command handler and repository. An event bus and
                            command bus are automatically created as part of the fixture.</para>

                            storing <code>MyAggregate</code> instances. This requires some
                            conventions on the MyAggregate class, as described in <xref
                                linkend="event-sourcing-repositories"/>.</para>

                        <para>These four lines define the actual scenario and its expected result.
                            The first line defines the events that happened in the past. These
                            events define the state of the aggregate under test. In practical terms,
                            these are the events that the event store returns when an aggregate is
                            loaded. The second line defines the command that we wish to execute
                            against our system. Finally, we have two more methods that define
                            expected behavior. In the example, we use the recommended void return
                            type. The last method defines that we expect a single event as result of
                            the command execution.</para>

        </para>
        <para>The given-when-then test fixture defines three stages: configuration, execution and
            validation. Each of these stages is represented by a different interface:
                <code>FixtureConfiguration</code>, <code>TestExecutor</code> and
                <code>ResultValidator</code>, respectively. The static
                <code>newGivenWhenThenFixture()</code> method on the <code>Fixtures</code> class
            provides a reference to the first of these, which in turn may provide the validator, and
            so forth.</para>
        <note>
            <para>To make optimal use of the migration between these stages, it is best to use the
                fluent interface provided by these methods, as shown in the example above.</para>
        </note>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Configuration</title>
            <para>During the configuration phase, you provide the building blocks required to
                execute the test. Specialized versions of the event bus, command bus and event store
                are provided as part of the fixture. There are getters in place to obtain references
                to them. The repository and command handlers need to be provided. This can be done
                using the <code>registerRepository</code> and <code>registerCommandHandler</code>
                (or <code>registerAnnotatedCommandHandler</code>) methods. If your aggregate allows
                the use of a generic repository, you can use the
                    <code>createGenericRepository</code> method to create a generic repository and
                register it with the fixture in a single call. The example above uses this
                feature.</para>
            <para>If the command handler and repository are configured, you can define the "given"
                events. These events need to be subclasses of <code>DomainEvent</code>, as they
                represent events coming from the event store. You do not need to set aggregate
                identifiers of sequence numbers. The fixture will inject those for you (using the
                aggregate identifier exposed by <code>getAggregateIdentifier</code> and a sequence
                number starting with 0.</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Execution</title>
            <para>The execution phase allows you to provide a command to be executed against the
                command handling component. That's all. Note that successful execution of this
                command requires that a command handler that can handle this type of command has
                been configured with the test fixture.</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Validation</title>
            <para>The last phase is the validation phase, and allows you to check on the activities
                of the command handling component. This is done purely in terms of return values and
                events (both stored and dispatched).</para>
            <para>The test fixture allows you to validate return values of you command handlers. You
                can explicitly define an expected void return value or any arbitrary value. You may
                also express the expectancy of an exception.</para>
            <para>The other component is validation of stored and dispatched events. In most cases,
                the stored and dispatched are equal. In some cases however, you may dispatch events
                (e.g. <code>ApplicationEvent</code>) that are not stored in the event store. In the
                first case, you can use the <code>expectEvents</code> method to validate events. In
                the latter case, you may use the <code>expectPublishedEvents</code> and
                    <code>expectStoredEvents</code> methods to validate published and stored events,
                respectively.</para>
