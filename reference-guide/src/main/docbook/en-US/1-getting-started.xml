    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <sect1>
        <title>Obtaining necessary libraries</title>
        <para>If you use maven as your build tool, you need to configure the correct dependencies
            for your project, as well as the repository configuration that tells maven where the
            jars are located. </para>
        <sect2>
            <title>Configuring maven</title>
            <para>Add the following code in your dependencies section:</para>
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
    <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>axon-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.4</version>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
            <para>Make sure your maven installation has access to the axon repository, where the
                necessary jars and poms are located. </para>
            <para>If you use a repository proxy, such as Artifactory, configure the following url:
                    <uri>http://axonframework.googlecode.com/svn/repo</uri>
            </para>
            <para>You can also add a repository configuration to you pom.xml:</para>
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>axon</id>
    <url>http://axonframework.googlecode.com/svn/repo</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>]]></programlisting>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Additional dependencies</title>
            <para>Most of the features provided by the Axon Framework are optional and require
                additional dependencies. We have chosen not to add these dependencies by default, as
                they would possibly clutter your project with stuff you don't need. </para>
            <simplesect>
                <title>Event Sourcing</title>
                <para>The event sourcing repository that is provided in Axon
                        (<code>XStreamFileSystemEventStore</code>) requires XStream. You need to add
                    the following maven dependency to your project to use this repository
                    implementation. </para>
                <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
    <groupId>com.thoughtworks.xstream</groupId>
    <artifactId>xstream</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.1</version>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
            </simplesect>
            <simplesect>
                <title>Spring Integration</title>
                <para>The Axon Framework provides connectors that allow you to publish events on a
                    Spring Integration channel. These connectors require Spring Integration on the
                    classpath. You need the following maven dependency to use these
                    connectors.</para>
                <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.3.RELEASE</version>
